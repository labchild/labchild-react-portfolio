                        I am a recent graduate of Columbia Univeristy's Full Stack Engineering Bootcamp.
                        I loved the process, and now I'm excited to beginning a career as a full stack engineer.

                        I received a BS from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY. Since 2014, I have been working
                        in hospitality and the arts in New York City. I'm always looking for a new puzzle, hobby, or obsession,
                        and coding has been a great fit.

                    <p>I currently live in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
