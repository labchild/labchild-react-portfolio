            I am a recent graduate of Columbia Univeristy's Full Stack
            Engineering Bootcamp. I loved the process, and now I'm excited to
            begin a career as a full stack engineer.
            I received a BS from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs,
            NY. Since 2014, I have been working in hospitality and the arts in
            New York City. I'm always looking for a new puzzle, hobby, or
            obsession, and coding has been a great fit.
